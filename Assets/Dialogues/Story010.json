{
  "speaker": "Leon",
  "message": "It is you! Why?"
},
{
  "speaker": "Velius",
  "message": "Why indeed? Because you meddle in affairs beyond your comprehension, Leon. But no matter. You've proven yourself a worthy opponent, and for that, I shall grant you a glimpse into the true depths of power."

{
  "speaker": "Velius",
  "message": "(chuckles darkly) The skull you see before you is no ordinary relic. It holds the essence of darkness long forgotten, a power that even the most skilled sorcerers dare not toy with. But you, Leon, you have piqued my interest."

{
  "speaker": "Leon",
  "message": "I don't understand. What do you want from me?"
},
{
  "speaker": "Velius",
  "message": "I want you to join me. Together, we could unlock the secrets of this world and wield unimaginable power. Imagine the possibilities, Leon. No longer shackled by the limitations of mortals, we could reshape reality itself."
},
{
  "speaker": "Leon",
  "message": "I'll never join you, Velius. Your darkness will be banished from this land."
},
{
  "speaker": "Velius",
  "message": "Oh, how naive. Do you think you can stop me? You're just a mere mortal standing before the might of a master wizard. But I admire your courage. So be it. If you choose to stand against me, prepare for the consequences. But for now, enjoy the company of my little friends. Farewell!"
